## Classification of Design Pattterns
-------------------------------------
Total number of design patterns is 24 which are divided into 3 categories as below:
- `Creational`: Creational patterns have a lot to do with creation of objects. These patterns are designed for the instantiation of classes. Some of the creational design patterns are - Abstract Factory, Builder, Factory Method, Object Pool, Prototype, and Singleton.
- `Behavioural`: Behavioral patterns are those design patterns that describe and identify the interactions between different objects. Making use of behavioral design patterns can reduce complicated flowcharts of the software design into simpler interconnections between various objects of classes.
- `Structural`: Structural patterns are useful in creating larger structures from smaller, individual parts that are in general, of different classes. These patterns can also be used to ease the design by recognizing a basic method for recognizing relationships among entities.
